# Matek

## Introduction
Matek is a static library written in C++, which provides mathematical features. It can be useful for scientific, financial or engineering solutions.

Matek operates with reliable numerical computations and accurately definable error limits, which is very important in several areas of application.

The library undergoes robust testing, which ensures stable, high-performance usage.

## Functionality

- **Numbers of any size**<br/>
You can use integer and rational numbers and perform basic operations on them. These numbers can be practically any size, there is only hardware limit.

- **Arbitrary accuracy arithmetic**<br/>
You can use rational numbers with arbitrary accuracy.

- **Multiple numeral systems**<br/>
You can create numbers and write them to the output in multiple numeral systems. Available bases are 10 (decimal) and 16 (hexadecimal).

- **Professional rounding features**<br/>
You can round rational numbers with several rounding methods and arbitrary accuracy.

- **Greatest common divisor and least common multiple**<br/>
You can use additional integer operations, such as GCD and LCM.

- **Power and root**<br/>
You can compute power and root with arbitrary rational exponent and degree.

- **Exponential function**<br/>
You can compute natural exponential function (e^x) with arbitrary rational exponent.

- **Logarithm**<br/>
You can compute natural logarithm, and logarithm with any rational base.

- **Trigonometry**<br/>
You can compute trigonometric functions with arbitrary accuracy.

- **Constants**<br/>
You can compute Euler's number and Pi with arbitrary accuracy.
