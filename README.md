# Matek

## Introduction
Matek is a static library written in C++, which provides mathematical features. It can be useful for scientific, financial or engineering solutions.

- **Numbers of any size**<br/>
You can use integer and rational numbers and perform basic operations on them. These numbers can be practically any size, there is only hardware limit.

- **Arbitrary accuracy arithmetic**<br/>
You can use rational numbers with arbitrary accuracy.

- **Multiple numeral systems**<br/>
You can create numbers and write them to the output in multiple numeral systems. Available bases are 10 (decimal) and 16 (hexadecimal).

- **Professional rounding features**<br/>
You can round rational numbers with several rounding method and arbitrary accuracy.

- **Greatest common divisor and least common multiple**<br/>
You can use additional integer operations, such as GCD and LCM.

- **Exponentiation and root.**<br/>
You can compute power and root with arbitrary rational exponent and degree.

- **Logarithm**<br/>
You can compute natural logarithm, and logarithm with any rational base
